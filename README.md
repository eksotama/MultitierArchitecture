# Multitier Architecture
In software engineering, multitier architecture (often referred to as n-tier architecture) or multilayered architecture is a clientâ€“server architecture in which presentation, application processing, and data management functions are physically separated. <br />

The most widespread use of multitier architecture is the three-tier architecture.  N-tier application architecture provides a model by which developers can create flexible and reusable applications. By segregating an application into tiers, developers acquire the option of modifying or adding a specific layer, instead of reworking the entire application. <br />

A three-tier architecture is typically composed of a presentation tier, a domain logic tier, and a data storage tier.
